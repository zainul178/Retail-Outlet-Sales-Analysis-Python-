## üîë Key Features  
### üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Product Insights**: Skincare dominates sales (45%), followed by haircare (29.5%) and cosmetics (25.5%).  
- **Revenue Analysis**: Carrier B generates the highest revenue despite higher shipping costs.  
- **Geographic Trends**: Mumbai has the most outlet records, while Delhi and Kolkata lead in average revenue.  
- **Cost Analysis**: 60% of transportation costs come from Road and Rail modes.  
- **Price Impact**: Skincare shows a strong positive correlation between price and revenue.  

### ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models**  
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts sales using `Price` and `MRP_Tier`.  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Captures non-linear patterns in sales data.  
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Identifies hierarchical decision rules for sales optimization.  

### üí° **Actionable Recommendations**  
- Prioritize skincare inventory and expand Carrier B partnerships.  
- Reduce Air transportation usage to cut logistics costs.  
- Optimize stock levels for high-demand SKUs (e.g., SKU4, SKU0).
